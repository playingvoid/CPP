Optimization laws involving Rules of duplicate eliminations
Single Table:
	DE(SEL(R)) = SEL(DE(R))

1. Check the table size (in block)
2. Table size should be less than equal to NUM_OF_BLOCKS_IN_MEMORY-1
3. IF it is not less then apply two pass algo
4. ELSE apply one pass algo
   For one pass
   While blocks of Relation are not read
   Read a block at memory index 0
      compare each tuple in block to memory(1 to n) block tuples
	  if  tuple is present ignore it
	  else output to a buffer and store in memory
